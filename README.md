# OpynSpecimen
An object oriented wrapper and tooling for the OpenSpecimen API, written in Python

## Introduction
This package is designed to help overcome various points of friction discovered while using [OpenSpecimen](https://github.com/krishagni/openspecimen).

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- An OpenSpecimen account with Super Admin privilege
- A Python environment with the NumPy, pandas, Requests, and jsonpickle libraries installed

## Documentation

### Core Classes
- Settings
- Translator
- Integrations
- Upload Classes

### Core Functionality
- The **Settings** class is where all the details of the OpenSpecimen API, and your particular instance of OpenSpecimen, live. It forms the basis for the other classes, which inherit their knowledge of the API, etc., from it. The intent here is to remove the need for non-technical folks to change things in the core functions of the Translator and Integrations objects. This approach does not always lead to the cleanest, most efficient code, but is often better for use in a business environment.
